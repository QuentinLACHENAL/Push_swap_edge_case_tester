# Push_swap_edge_case_tester

I noticed a lot of push_swap projects are wrong.

This is a test to compare the output of your program with the OFFICIAL linux tester.

Just put push_swap and checker_linux in the same folder then run with:

bash ultimate_tests_english.sh

(or ultimate_tests.sh for french version)
